# Robo-Tourney
A decade-long project to build the ultimate NCAA March Madness bracket picking algorithm. `Robot2.ipynb` runs the latest and greatest code to scrape College Basketball regular season statistics and tourament brackets. The notebook defines a simple interface for a function (i.e. your bracket packing robot) that picks winners of matchups, and has code to run this robot against historical regular season data and tournament brackets.
